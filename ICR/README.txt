This set of MATLAB files contain an implementation of the algorithms
described in the following papers:

[1] H. S. Mousavi, V. Monga, T.D. Tran, 
ICR: Iterative Convex Refinement for Sparse Signal Recovery Using Spike and slab Priors
Signal Processing Letters, 2015.


ICR solves the spike and slab sparse recovery problem 
with applications in compressed sensing, image restoration
and reconstruction, sparse regression, classification and 
several other problems.

The code is available at http://signal.ee.psu.edu/ICR.zip

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The main files implementing the algorithms are SALSA_v2.m and CSALSA_v2.m

For usage details, type  "help ICR_Func" at the MATLAB prompt.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
This version of ICR has only been tested on MATLAB 7.14.0 (R2012) or later and all of 
our testing was done on the Windows 7 platform.
